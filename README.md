# Employee Management System

The Employee Management System is a full-featured application designed to manage and track employee tasks, performance, and roles within an organization. It allows administrators to assign tasks, monitor progress, and categorize work for each employee, while employees can view, update, and manage their tasks. The app focuses on providing an efficient, user-friendly platform to streamline employee workflow and productivity.

- Task Management: Each employee is assigned tasks with properties like status (active, completed, failed), task title, description, and due dates.
- Admin Dashboard: Administrators can create, assign, and track tasks for employees, view progress, and update employee profiles.
- Task Categorization: Tasks can be grouped into different categories for better organization and filtering.
- Real-time Updates: Employees and admins can monitor task statuses with real-time updates.
- Authentication: Simple login system for admin and employee accounts with secure password management.
